# Nick Norman - Business Intelligence Portfolio
## About

Hi, I'm Nick! I recently graduated in April 2025 with a Bachelor of Management and Organizational Studies from Western University, specializing in Business Intelligence. Through coursework, my role as a Data Analyst Intern at the Better Business Bureau, and running my own service-based startup, I've built a strong foundation in data analytics, dashboard development, and statistical analysis. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of business intelligence as an entry-level BI analyst. 

My work includes data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization using tools like Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI. I've built interactive dashboards to support business decisions, automated reporting pipelines, and applied predictive analytics to uncover insights that drive growth. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new BI tools, contributing to peer development as a volunteer career advisor, and continously finding ways to connect data with meaningful outcomes. I'm excited to continue developing as a data analyst and business intelligence professional, and to bring my curoisty, grit, and technical skills to impactful, data-driven roles. 

This repository is to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progess in Business Intelligence/Data Analytics related topics.
